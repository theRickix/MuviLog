Java cinema collector organizer software project made in January 2015 for "Programming Languages II" (Universidade Lus√≥fona do Porto, Computer Engineering), with fellow colleague Diogo Monteiro. I might continue to improve this as a hobby. Basically, it can manage films, along with its formats, watches and borrowings. The film's information is retrieved from IMDb and stored in a local database. It uses H2 and Gson libraries to work. Also, it's currently in Portuguese; I will translate it later. You're free to contribute and/or base your own app from it.
